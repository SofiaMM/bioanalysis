This work contains 3 folders: java_project, bioeco_database, and data_analysis. In the first one contains the java files of the bioanalysis project, that were developed so the data from SISBI was imported and so a new database, bioanalysis, was created and populated in MySQL. The second folder includes dump files of the exported database from MySQL Workbench (named bioeco in this tool). Lastly, the third folder contains MySQL queries that analysed the data from bioanalysis and a jupyter notebook file with all the price analysis algorithms (these files can only be executed with the database).
